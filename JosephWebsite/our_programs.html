                                            Joseph Academy is a Private, Non Profit, Therapeutic Day School that works with Chicago Area school district
                                            Special Education representatives who place students in the program. Local school districts or social service
                                            agencies may have criteria regarding who they refer to our school. You may contact your local public school

                                            Education Plan (IEP) must be completed along with a formal interview of the family. If you have further
                                            questions regarding your child's potential acceptance into our program, please feel free to contact us.

                                                    The reinforcement of positive student behavior is achieved through
                                                    the motivation system, which is divided into five levels of
                                                    advancement. Points must be earned to advance from one level to
                                                    the next, and with each new level, students gain responsibilities.
                                                    Students are awarded points every day for academic work and
                                                    good behavior. They can lose points as well for inappropriate
                                                    actions. With accumulated points, student buy items from the
                                                    school store or earn privileges.<br><br>
                                                    Within the Level System, Joseph Academy utilizes a point system
                                                    based on the Boys Town model. The point system is the foundation
                                                    for determining movement between the five (5) levels. As with the
                                                    Level System, the goal is to effect behavioral change and growth to
                                                    increase the students successful participation in both the
                                                    alternative and mainstream settings.

                                                    counterparts in regular classrooms, but with greater structure
                                                    and individual attention. The curriculum is based on the
                                                    requirements of each sending school district and the goals and

                                                    We work closely with each student's sending public school
                                                    district to ensure that the student is enrolled in the appropriate
                                                    academic classes. Many students have the opportunity to

                                                    use core subjects to prepare for a G.E.D., students who are
                                                    frequently tardy to school in the morning, or an alternative

                                                    This program is for students with or without an IEP in grades K
                                                    through 8, who may need a temporary option due to
                                                    suspensions for disruptive school behavior, or an interim
                                                    alternative classroom due to other problems. Students will be
                                                    able to take advantage of Joseph Academy’s therapeutic support

                                                    individualized curriculum specifically designed to address each
                                                    student’s academic levels of performance. It is hoped that
                                                    students who have completed the STAR program will have
                                                    developed a more positive attitude toward school, or show a
                                                    more focused attitude for school goals and want to change some
                                                    previous unproductive patterns.
